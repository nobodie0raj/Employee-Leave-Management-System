# Employee-Leave-Management-System
An Employee Leave Management System DBMS project is a software application that allows an organization to manage employee leave requests and approvals through a database management system
Here are the general steps to run the Employee-Leave-Management-System DBMS project on your computer:

1. Install a web server such as Apache or Nginx on your computer. You can use a pre-built package like XAMPP or WAMP that includes a web server, a database server, and other necessary components.
2. Install a database management system like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Again, you can use a pre-built package like XAMPP or WAMP that includes a database server.
3. Download the project files from GitHub and extract them to a directory on your computer.
4. Import the database schema provided in the project files into your database management system. You can use a tool like phpMyAdmin to import the schema.
5. Edit the database configuration settings in the project files to match your database settings. You will need to update the database name, username, and password in the file "config.php".
6. Place the project files in the appropriate directory on your web server. For example, if you are using XAMPP, you can place the files in the "htdocs" directory.
7. Start the web server and the database server.
8. Open a web browser and navigate to the project URL. For example, if you are using XAMPP and the project files are in the "htdocs" directory, you can navigate to "http://localhost/Employee-Leave-Management-System" to access the application.
9. The application should now be running, and you can start testing it by logging in as an administrator or an employee.
